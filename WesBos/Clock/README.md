## My process

### Built with

<!-- - Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow -->

### What I learned

The first iteration of this clock checked the time every second and updated the clock accordingly, but then I realized that it would be easier to just check the time at the beginning and start a repeating animation from there. There's no real need to keep checking the time if the animation is timed right. The challenge the new strategy introduced was to keep the background in sync, because that had been controlled previously as part of the time-checking process.

### Continued development

<!-- Want to improve focus states and accessibility next time. -->
