## Overview

This is my first Frontend Mentor Challenge. It was pretty easy in terms of the html/css, somewhat difficult figuring out GitHub Pages and admin stuff.

## My process

Muddle through.
Time estimate was about right for the coding part (~1.5h), but all the back-end stuff and trying to get GitHub Pages set up especially was a bit difficult and time-consuming.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (learning)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Really need to get more comfortable using GitHub.
To improve/incorporate:
-Semantic HTML
-CSS custom properties
