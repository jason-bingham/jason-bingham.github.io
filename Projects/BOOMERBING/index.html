    <h2>A Few Words About BOOMER|BING</h2>
    <p>Jimi Bingham, the driving force behind BOOMER|BING, is a Motivational Speaker & Business Coach who specializes in providing motivational and sales training seminars to the staff of businesses desiring to maximize sales and profitability. Jimi is passionate about leveraging his 40+ years of sales and management experience to improve the performance of sales and marketing teams, and to help guide them through the ever-changing business landscape we all find ourselves in.</p>
    <p>Our target market includes businesses that are owned or managed by Baby Boomers, or that employ staff that were born after 1948! Why? Because most Baby Boomers have an inherent work ethic that, with a little motivation tweaking coupled with effective sales training, enables them to appreciate their talents and skill sets and understand their roles as they affect the overall profitability of any business.</p>
    <p>A happy, well-trained employee is more productive than the typical employee, and therefore is more valuable to the employer and to their fellow employees. Understanding their role in the organization is crucial to the overall success of a business enterprise, and developing the skill sets that ensure massive productivity can result in exponential increases in profitability for the company and personal satisfaction in the workplace.</p>
