          <h2 class="intro__heading">About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Jimi Bingham, AKA Boomer Bing, is a Motivational Speaker & Business
            Coach with 40+ years of sales and management experience. He
            specializes in providing motivational and sales training seminars to
            the management and staff of diverse businesses, with a focus on
            maximizing sales and profitability, while maintaining staff
            well-being and job satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Boomer Bing's target market includes businesses that are owned or
            managed by Baby Boomers, or that employ staff that were born after
            1948! Why? Because most Baby Boomers have an inherent work ethic
            that, with a little motivation tweaking coupled with effective sales
            training, enables them to appreciate their talents and skill sets
            and understand their roles as they affect the overall profitability
            of any business.
          </p>
          <p>
            A happy, well-trained employee is more productive than the typical
            employee, and therefore is more valuable to the employer and to
            their fellow employees. Understanding their role in the organization
            is crucial to the overall success of a business enterprise, and
            developing the skill sets that ensure massive productivity can
            result in exponential increases in profitability for the company and
            personal satisfaction in the workplace.
