## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got too hung up trying to make this work as a dynamic grid layout and ended up wasting a lot of time unnecessarily. In the end it was a lot easier and more straightforward just going with flexbox.

### Continued development

Want to improve focus states and accessibility next time.
